## How to Install

The installer file:  ``install.sh`` will source and download the extension, and place the files where they need to be on your system correctly.  You can run the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/loopyd/install-grass.git
cd install-grass
chmod +x ./install-grass.sh
sudo ./install-grass.sh
```

On some distrobutions, installation of additional packages will be required.  The installer will prompt you which to search your package manager for, and install **manually**.  The names of the packages may vary based upon your distrobution.  You can access your package maintainer's resources to locate and install the nessecary packages.
