> üå± The Grass Desktop Node is now **out of beta** and __public__!  You can now use this utility reliably in your Linux Distrobution of choice (outside Debian and Ubuntu)!

This installer is an effort the build an automated Linux installer to support the [Grass Desktop Node](https://app.getgrass.io/dashboard/store/item/desktop) on  Linux Distrobutions where the app is not available due to lack of ``.deb`` package support.

## Compatibility

The following Linux flavors where tested with the installer present in this repository

| Distrobution | Version | Status | Notes |
| --- | --------| ------ | ----- |
| Ubuntu | 22.04 | **OK** | Choose xfce or lxde variants. |
| Ubuntu | 24.04 | **OK** | Choose xfce or lxde variants. |
| Debian | Bookworm | **TESTING** | Some package locations and names differ. |
| Ziron Linux | 22.04 | **TESTING** | Choose xfce or lxde Window Manager |
| Arch Linux | 2024.06.01 | **TESITNG** | Worked well after CA patch, doesn't work in Plasma |
