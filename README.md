This installer is an effort the build an automated Linux installer to suport the [Grass Desktop Node](https://app.getgrass.io/dashboard/store/item/desktop) on  Linux Distrobutions where the app is not available due to lack of ``.deb`` package support.

> If you have not claimed a Beta Referral Code on the Grass dashboard via the [Grass Store](https://app.getgrass.io/dashboard/store) , you will recieve a login failure when attempting to log into the application. This is not a bug. **Do not create issues with it.**
