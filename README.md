This installer is an effort the build an automated Linux installer to suport the desktop node on  Linux Distrobutions where the Grass Desktop Node is not available.  Currently, the official version of the Grass Desktop node is available by referral only service from a Gigabud holder during the Beta period.

> If you have not claimed a referral code on the Grass dashboard, you will recieve a login failure when attempting to access the application.

The installer file:  ``install.sh`` will source and download the extension, and place the files where they need to be on your system correctly.
